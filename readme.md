#IOI-HA Outcome Tracker

## Project Description:

The **International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids** is a seven item
__standardized__ measure which has been translated into **30 different languages**.  
It was originally designed for evaluating the efficacy of hearing aid rehabilitation.
It is standard practice to ask patients to complete a **IOIHA** at least one month
after being fit with hearing aids.  However an outcome measure means nothing
unless you are tracking and analyzing the data.

I currently work with six different hearing aid vendors *(the big six)*.  Although
all hearing aids do the same thing (amplify sound), they all do it in different ways.  
I like to track the **IOIHA** outcome based on the Make and Style of the hearing aid.  
Are patients doing better with RIC style hearing aids than with Full Shell (FS) style
hearing aids?  Are patients doing better with one company's hearing aids compared
to another company?  Being able to answer these questions will help me improve
my treatment for future patients.  

The point of this web application is to create a database of IOIHA outcomes based
on Make, Model and style of hearing aid, then use those results to determine which
treatment is working best for my patients.
